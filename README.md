# Canteen-Management-System

This mini project on the canteen management system depicts how a student/customer goes to the canteen, orders food online on the canteen site and the food gets served in the canteen. 
The benefits of this system are as follows:
1.	An improved customer service
2.	More time to browse the menu
3.	More customer control over orders
4.	Easier to place larger orders

Using the canteen management system as our topic for the project we drew some required UML diagrams as the Use case, Class, Sequence, Communication, State chart, Activity, Package, Component, and Deployment diagram.
